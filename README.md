* **Food & Beverage Preferences:** Identifies the **most popular food options** chosen by guests to inform menu planning and inventory management.
* **Booking Demographics:** Analyzes the average booking composition to determine the ratio of **Singular Travellers vs. Family Bookings**, aiding in room type allocation and marketing strategies.
